# How does it work?

After installing the extension, visit Pinnacle gradebook by Broward schools and click on one of your classes. There is a menu located to the right of the name of the class and to the left of the grade in the class. Input the name, the points achieved, and the points total and click "Add assignment". Your grade will update while you remain in the webpage and will show you what your new grade would be after adding the fake grade.
